    <section id="about" class="card">
      <h2>About PWDs</h2>
      <p>Persons with Disabilities (PWDs) are individuals who have long-term physical, mental, intellectual, or sensory impairments. 
      According to the World Health Organization, over 1 billion people worldwide live with some form of disability. 
      Disabilities may be visible (e.g., mobility impairments) or invisible (e.g., learning disabilities, mental health conditions).</p>
      <p>Our mission is to spread awareness, promote inclusion, and provide accessible resources to ensure that no one is left behind.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Rights Section -->
    <section id="rights" class="card">
      <h2>Rights of PWDs</h2>
      <p>PWDs are entitled to the same fundamental rights as everyone else. Key rights include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Equal access to education, employment, and public services.</li>
        <li>Right to live with dignity and independence.</li>
        <li>Freedom from discrimination and abuse.</li>
        <li>Accessible transportation, buildings, and digital spaces.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>In the Philippines, Republic Act No. 7277 (Magna Carta for Disabled Persons) protects these rights. 
      Globally, the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD) sets international standards.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Education Section -->
    <section id="education" class="card">
      <h2>Education for PWDs</h2>
      <p>Inclusive education is about ensuring that learners with disabilities study alongside peers in supportive environments. 
      Barriers to education include lack of assistive devices, inaccessible classrooms, and social stigma.</p>
      <p><strong>Examples of educational support:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Braille materials and audiobooks for blind students.</li>
        <li>Sign language interpreters for the deaf.</li>
        <li>Assistive software for students with learning disabilities.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Education opens opportunities and breaks down barriers for PWDs to become independent and active members of society.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Employment Section -->
    <section id="employment" class="card">
      <h2>Employment Opportunities</h2>
      <p>Work is a powerful way for PWDs to live independently. Unfortunately, many face discrimination in hiring and promotion. 
      Companies should embrace inclusivity by providing training, accommodations, and equal opportunities.</p>
      <p><strong>Benefits of hiring PWDs:</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>Diverse and inclusive workforce.</li>
        <li>Improved creativity and problem-solving.</li>
        <li>Stronger social responsibility image.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Philippine law (RA 10524) requires that at least 1% of positions in government agencies be reserved for PWDs.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- Health Section -->
    <section id="health" class="card">
      <h2>Health and Support Services</h2>
      <p>PWDs require accessible healthcare services, including rehabilitation, therapy, and counseling. 
      Public health programs should ensure that facilities, equipment, and communication are inclusive for all.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Affordable assistive devices (wheelchairs, hearing aids, prosthetics).</li>
        <li>Accessible clinics and hospitals.</li>
        <li>Mental health support for PWDs and families.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Access to healthcare ensures not only survival but also quality of life for PWDs.</p>
